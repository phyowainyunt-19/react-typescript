# React Typescript

TypeScript with React by building a few components of varying complexity. With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're typing the code, rather than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime. TypeScript wtih React also provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete. Typescript even makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.
